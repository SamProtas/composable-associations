# composable-associations

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/SamProtas/composable-associations.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/SamProtas/composable-associations)

This repo contains core types/functions in `composable-associations` and the first serialization format implementation JSON (Aeson) in `composable-associations-aeson`. 

Documentation can be found in either subdirectory. It is written primarily for Haddocks so the quickstarts/descriptions reside in the source code.

TODO: Haddock links here?
