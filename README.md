# composable-associations

This repo contains core types/functions in `composable-associations` and the first serialization format implementation JSON (Aeson) in `composable-associations-aeson`. 

Documentation can be found in either subdirectory. It is written primarily for Haddocks so the quickstarts/descriptions reside in the source code.

TODO: Haddock links here?
